# rust-lang-tutorial

To get started install rust first using below command

```console 
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

once installation done, Open a terminal and check installation using 

```console

## Cargo: the Rust build tool and package manager

When you install Rustup youâ€™ll also get the latest stable version of the Rust build tool and package manager, also known as Cargo. Cargo does lots of things:

build your project with 
```console 
    cargo build
```
run your project with cargo run
```console 
    cargo run
```
test your project with cargo test
```console 
    cargo test
```
build documentation for your project with cargo doc
```console 
    cargo doc
```
publish a library to crates.io with cargo publish
```console 
    cargo publish
```
To test that you have Rust and Cargo installed, you can run this in your terminal of choice:

```console 
    cargo --version
```
