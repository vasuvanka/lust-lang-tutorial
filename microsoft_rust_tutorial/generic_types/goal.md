# Learning objectives

Discover `traits` and `generics`, which are Rust's way to deal with the concept of `polymorphism`

In this module, you'll learn:

- What generic types are and how "wrapper" types use them.
- What traits are and how they help us define shared behavior.
- How to implement an existing trait for a custom type.
- How to implement a custom trait for an existing type.
- How trait bounds help us write generic functions.
- How to implement an Iterator trait to iterate through collections.
